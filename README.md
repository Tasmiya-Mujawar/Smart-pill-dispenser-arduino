Arduino-based smart pill dispenser simulated on Tinkercad

# Smart Pill Dispenser – Arduino (Tinkercad)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Smart Pill Dispenser designed using Arduino and simulated on Tinkercad.
It helps dispense medicine and alerts the user using a buzzer.

This project is suitable for beginners in embedded systems and robotics.

---

## 🧠 Objective
- To automate pill dispensing
- To give an alert when medicine is dispensed
- To learn Arduino programming and sensor–actuator interfacing

---

## 🧩 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Potentiometer
- Servo Motor / Stepper Motor
- Buzzer
- Push Button (Reset)
- Jumper Wires

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. When the circuit is powered ON or reset, the system initializes.
2. The potentiometer is used as an input control.
3. When the potentiometer value crosses a defined threshold:
   - The motor rotates to dispense the pill
   - The buzzer turns ON to alert the user
4. The system waits for reset and then repeats the process.

## 💻 Software & Tools
- Arduino IDE (code written in Arduino C)
- Tinkercad Circuits (for simulation)
- GitHub (for version control)

---

## 🔬 Simulation Details
- The complete circuit is designed and tested in Tinkercad.
- No physical hardware was used.
- The project behavior matches real hardware logic.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add RTC module for time-based dispensing
- Add ESP8266 for mobile notifications
- Add LCD display for medicine status
